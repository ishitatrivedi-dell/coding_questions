# 💻 Coding Practice – React & Node.js (2025)

This repository contains solutions to coding questions from the [Coding Gita Full Stack Development 2025](https://github.com/codinggita/full_stack_development_2025/tree/main/interview/machine_coding) repository. These questions are designed to improve and evaluate real-world coding skills in **React** and **Node.js**, commonly asked in technical interviews.

---

## ✅ Goal

- Solve **15+ coding problems** in total (React and/or Node.js).
- Practice clean, readable, and interview-ready code.
- Build real-world mini features and REST APIs.
